author: Yifei Zhang
abstract: "This project aims at answering the following research questions: 1. Is there a trend in PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai from 2012 to 2017? 2. What is the spatial pattern of PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang in 2017? The U.S. Department of State Air Quality Dataset is used to answer the research questions. Results show that from 2012 to 2017, there existed a decreasing trend in PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai. In addition, pronounced seasonal variation is observed in PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai, with the highest concentrations typically observed in the winter and the lowest concentrations generally found in the summer. Among the 5 cities, Beijing and Chengdu showed highest average PM2.5 concentration in 2017, with the AQI level reaching 158."

# Research Question and Rationale

<Paragraph detailing the rationale for your analysis. What is the significant application and/or interest in this topic? Connect to environmental topic(s)/challenge(s).>

Air pollution is a severe problem in China. It is often the smoggy air that occurs to many people when it comes to Beijing, the capital of China. Among the air pollutants, of particular concern is PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 um). Exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 results in risks to the cardiovascular system, cerebrovascular system and an increase in the probability of cancer and premature death. In recent years, China’s government has taken serious action against air pollution, but there is still a long way to go.

<Paragraph detailing your research question(s) and goals. What do you want to find out? Include a sentence (or a few) on the dataset you are using to answer this question - just enough to give your reader an idea of where you are going with the analysis.>

Given the increasing public concern in air quality and the efforts of Chinese government to fight air pollution, I am interested in the actual outcomes: whether or not there is a decreasing trend in air quality over the years. In particular, I want to examine the PM2.5 trend in Shanghai because it is the largest city in China by population, and it is also where I come from. I will use the The U.S. Department of State air quality files, which contain the hourly PM2.5 concentrations in 5 cities in China from 2011 to 2017. With this dataset, my second research question is to look at the spatial pattern of PM2.5 concentrations in these 5 cities.

Goals:

- Use Mann-Kendall test to analyze trends in PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai from 2012 to 2017
- Run a Pettitt's Test to check if there are changing points
- Check for seasonality in PM2.5 concentrations.
- Use Seasonal Mann-Kendall test if there is seasonality
- Look at which city has the highest average PM2.5 concentration.

# Dataset Information

<Information on how the dataset for this analysis were collected, the data contained in the dataset, and any important pieces of information that are relevant to your analyses. This section should contain much of same information as the README file for the dataset but formatted in a way that is more narrative.>

The U.S. Department of State air quality files contain hourly PM2.5 or data in concentration units from each post, as reported on the www.stateair.net website.
Files include hourly data with the following file name structure:
Site_Year_DurationParameter.csv.
Filename examples: Beijing_2013_HourlyPM2.5.csv

All files contain the following column headers: Site, Parameter, Date (LST), Year, Month, Day, Hour, Value, Unit, Duration, QC Name. Definitions and examples of column headers can be found in the table below.

The air quality data are measured at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and at the Consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang.


<Add a table that summarizes your data structure. This table can be made in markdown text or inserted as a `kable` function in an R chunk. If the latter, do not include the code used to generate your table.>

*The changing points in figure 5 seem to be due to the seasonal variations, so I decide to look at the monthly variation of PM2.5 concentration to see if there exists seasonality*

*Figure 6 shows that the PM2.5 concentraions do vary a lot over months. Generally the concentrations peak in Winter and reach lowest in Summer. Therefore, I decide to run a Seasonal Mann-Kendall test to reduce to effect of seasonal trends that obscure the overall direction of the trend*

*Figure 7 shows the average PM2.5 concentration in 5 cities in China in 2017. The larger the circle, the higher the concentration. In the HTML format, the exact AQI value will pop up if the circle is clicked, but this function is not available in the PDF format.*

# Summary and Conclusions
<Summarize your major findings from your analyses. What conclusions do you draw from your findings? Make sure to apply this to a broader application for the research question you have answered.>

Pronounced seasonal variation is observed in PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai, with the highest concentrations typically observed in the winter and the lowest concentrations generally found in the summer. From 2012 to 2017, there existed a decreasing trend in PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai(Seasonal Mann-Kendall test, p-value = 0.008873, S = -44). China's government has made some progress to improve air quality. However, the 2017 average AQI in Shanghai was 125, which falls into the "unhealthy for sensitive groups" range. 

As for other 4 cities, Beijing and Chengdu showed highest PM2.5 concentration in 2017, with the AQI level reaching 158. Guangzhou showed lowest AQI in 2017, which is 114; the 2017 average AQI in Shenyang was 153, also within the unhealthy range. Transportation and Coal combustion are two major sources of PM2.5 in China. Transportation contributes a lot to the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing and Chengdu. These two cities rank first and second in terms of car ownership in China.
