## Data information
The data are retrieved from The U.S. Department of State air quality files.

The datasets conctain hourly PM2.5 concentrations in 5 cities of China from 2011 to 2017. All files contain the following column headers: Site, Parameter, Date (LST), Year, Month, Day, Hour, Value, Unit, Duration, QC Name. Definitions and examples of column headers can be found in the table below.

The air quality data are measured at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and at the Consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang. the coordinates of each site is given in the table below.

Site location | Latitude and Longitude Degrees|
----------    | ------------------------------|
Beijing       | 39.95, 116.47                 |
Chengdu       | 30.63, 104.07                 |
Guangzhou     | 23.12, 113.32                 |
Shanghai      | 31.21, 121.44                 |
Shenyang      | 41.78, 123.42                 |

## Research questions

1. Is there a trend in PM2.5 concentrations in Shanghai from 2012 to 2017? 
2. What is the spatial pattern of PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang in 2017?
